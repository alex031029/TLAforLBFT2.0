# TLA+ for LBFT 2.0

This repo contains formal speficiation files written in TLA+ for LBFT 2.0. 
In general, all files are simply drafts, and the formal one will be udpated in CPChain main repo. 

Each lbft*i*.tla shows each version I wrote this TLA+, where *i* is an integer. The larger *i* is, the later version it is. 

The latest version (i.e., the one with largest *i*) may not be executed without errors. 
In priciple, All older version should terminate without raising any error. 
However, an older version indicates it must contain some lack of consideration or logic. 

A CHANGELOG is updated on explaining the difference between versions.
