# TLA+ for LBFT 2.0

This repo contains formal speficiation files written in TLA+ for LBFT 2.0. 
In general, all files are simply drafts, and the formal one will be udpated in CPChain main repo. 

Each lbft*i*.tla shows each version I wrote this TLA+, where *i* is an integer. The larger *i* is, the later version it is. 

The latest version (i.e., the one with largest *i*) may not be executed without errors. All older version should terminate without raising any error, in principle.
